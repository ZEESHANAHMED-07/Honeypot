# 🐝 Honeypot Project

A high-interaction honeypot designed to detect, log, and analyze malicious activity in a controlled environment.  
This project is built on Kali Linux and configured to mimic vulnerable services while capturing attacker behavior.

- Simulates vulnerable services (SSH, HTTP, etc.).
- Stores logs in structured files for later analysis.
- Extensible design for adding more traps and services.

⚙️ Setup
1. Clone the repo
```bash

git clone git@github.com:ZEESHANAHMED-07/Honeypot.git
cd Honeypot
```


2. Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```


3. Install dependencies
```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure your honeypot

Logs are stored in the logs/ directory.

SSH keys remain local only inside keys/ (not pushed to GitHub).

Update src/config.py (if provided) to set ports, services, etc.

▶️ Usage

Run the honeypot:
```bash


python src/honeypot.py
```
Logs will be generated under:
```text
logs/
```

🔒 Security Notes

⚠️ Important:

Run this only in a controlled environment (VM, VPS).

Never expose sensitive logs or private keys publicly.

Use for research and educational purposes only.

✅ Now it will render beautifully on GitHub with code blocks for commands, tree structures, and diagrams.  

Do you want me to also add **badges** (like Python version, license, repo size, etc.) at the top of your README to make it look extra professional?
